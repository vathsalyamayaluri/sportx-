            Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a 
            less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.
            The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball
             became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar 
             enterprise by the end of the century,
             and basketball became an integral part of American culture. 
        </p>

       <h1>Origin:</h1>
       <p>
        The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young
         athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as Springfield College)
          in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in 
          cold weather.  <br> <br> It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into
           two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the
            fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder
             and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. The first
         public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.
       </p>
       <h1>The first Basketball Game:</h1>

       <p>
        On December 21, 1891, Naismith published rules for a new game using five basic ideas and thirteen rules.[4] That day, he asked his class to play a match in the
         Armory Street court: 9 versus 9, using a soccer ball and two peach baskets. Frank Mahan, one of his students, wasn't so happy. He just said: "Harrumph. Another 
         new game". Someone proposed to call it "Naismith Game", but he suggested "We have a ball and a basket: why don't we call it basketball?" The eighteen players 
         were John G. Thompson, Eugene S. Libby, Edwin P. Ruggles, William R. Chase, T. Duncan Patton, Frank Mahan, Finlay G. MacDonald, William H. Davis and Lyman Archibald, 
         who defeated George Weller, Wilbert Carey, Ernest Hildner, Raymond Kaighn, Genzabaro Ishikawa, Benjamin S. French, Franklin Barnes, George Day and Henry Gelan 1-0.
          The goal was scored by Chase. <br> <br> There were other differences between Naismith's first idea and the game played today. The peach baskets were closed, and balls had to be
           retrieved manually, until a small hole was put in the bottom of the peach basket to poke the ball out using a stick. Only in 1906 were metal hoops, nets and backboards introduced. In 1894 the soccer ball 
        was replaced by a ball Naismith contacted Spalding to make.

        The formation of the FIBA:
    </h1>
    <p>

        In the first decades of this sport, it was growing, but it didn't really have any real international organization. It required several petitions by basketball supporters for 
        it to be included as an Olympic demonstration in 1904.  <br> <br>
        
        However, this all changed in 1932 when the FIBA came into being. The work of the FIBA on the international game helped it to become an Olympic sport in 1936, which 
        was then won by the US National Team.  <br> <br>
        
        The inventor- Naismith- lived long enough to get to see the sport he created become a recognized Olympic sport, 45 years after its invention. <br> <br>

       How basketball took the world by storm:

    </h1>
    <p>

        Basketball got introduced to the rest of the world thanks to the US Army and the YMCA. Then in 1893, the first ever international basketball match was organized,
         and members of the took the game to India, Persia, China, and Japan.  <br> <br>
        
        By 1900, a majority of major colleges were fielding a team, and in 1905 formal collegiate rules were introduced for basketball, and in 1909, the NCAA took over the 
        game for cool. The very first NCAA DI tournament was held in 1939.  <br> <br>
        
        The sport rapidly grew within its inventors' lifetime, and now, we don't know what we would do without it. <br> <br>
