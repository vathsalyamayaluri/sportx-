    <h1>General Rules :</h1>
        <ul type="circle">
         <li class="b">Touching the net with the body or the racket is illegal and will result in the loss 
        of the serve or a point awarded to the serving team.        
         </li>
        <li class="b">
         Only one hit is allowed per side.

         Shuttles that land on the boundary lines are considered in.

    <h1>Service Rules :</h1>
        <p>
        Both the server and receiver must keep both feet on the ground and not be moving when
        the shuttle is served.
        </p>
        <p>
        When serving - the shuttle must be hit below the waist with the head of the racket 
        below the wrist.

        diagonally across the net and pass the opponents 10 foot line.

    <h1>Doubles :</h1>
        <p>
        In order to figure out who will serve first, a rally will occur. The birdie must go over
        the net at least three times. Whichever team wins the rally will serve first.
        </p>
        <p>
        The partner in the right-hand serving court serves first in each inning. When a score is
        made, the person who served continues to serve in the opposite side of the court.
        On each score the serving partners switch sides of the court so they serve alternating 
        from one side of the court to the other side of the court.
        </p>
        <p>
        The server must serve the birdie diagonally.
        </p>
        <p>
        After the rally, the team that starts serving will only serve until the first server's
        serve is interrupted. The other team will then serve from the right side of the court.
        After the first inning the partners will serve consecutively.
        </p>
        <p>
         The doubles service court is short and wide.
        </p>
        <h1>Singles :</h1>
        <p>The first serve and all even points are served from the right-hand serving court.
        All odd points are served from the left-hand serving court</p>

        mistake is discovered.In a doubles match between A & B against C & D. A & B won the toss
        and decided to serve. A to serve to C. A shall be the initial server while C shall be
